"""Turn a built H3 shot into a Wan 3.0 (TopView) prompt: positional image references, at most 3,500 characters.

    python3 wan3_prompt.py n01 [n02 ...] [--token at|angle] [--out DIR]

For each shot key (o01, m04, n13, ...) writes <out>/<key>.wan3.json:
    {key, title, seconds, images: [Drive paths under Element/, in upload order], prompt, chars}
CTO_Wan3.0_TopView §5 is the checklist this follows: uploads in first-mention order, each @Handle replaced by
its position with the fixed name kept, the H3 studio markers replaced by a plain sound line, the house-negatives
wall dropped, and the reference descriptions shortened first if the prompt runs over 3,500 characters.
Which reference token the live Direction box accepts is not measured yet: --token picks "@Image 1" (at, the
default, what the UI inserts) or "<<<Image1>>>" (angle, TopView's own example prompts).
