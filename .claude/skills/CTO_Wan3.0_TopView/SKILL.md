  Generating with Wan 3.0 on TopView (topview.ai): how references are written (positional, no Element
  library), the 3,500-character Direction box, prices and plans, several shots in one generation, the
  TopView Wan3 Challenge rules, and the checklist for turning a MiniMax H3 previz prompt into a Wan3 prompt.
  Trigger on /CTO_Wan3.0_TopView and whenever a task says Wan3, Wan 3.0, TopView, "Topview Wan3
  Challenge", "ส่งประกวด TopView", "แปลง prompt ไป Wan3", "@Image 1", or prepares final footage for the
  ILAG trailer. Do NOT fire for the H3 previz itself (CTO_MiniMax_H3), Seedance/Higgsfield
  (CTO_Seedance2.5_Higgsfield) or Google Flow (CTO_Flow_Omni1.1_Ops); prompt-file layout lives in
  CTO_Film_PromptFormat.

# Wan 3.0 · TopView

**Status (2026-09-26): the generator UI, the costs and the reference tokens are measured (dry runs of
`tools/topview_wan3.py`); no clip has been generated yet, because the account was on the Free plan.** Facts
marked *measured* below come from that run; the rest is still TopView's own text.

Sources, with URLs and verbatim quotes: `docs/promo/TOPVIEW-WAN3-REFERENCES.md` (model, references, prices)
and `docs/promo/TOPVIEW-WAN3-RULES.md` (the challenge). This skill is the working summary; those files are
the evidence.

## 1 · Rules

1. **HARD: every paid generation needs the CEO's OK with the exact credits and $ first.**
   **Why hard:** money. On Pro, 720p costs 0.5 credit per second (80 credits = 160 s).
2. **HARD (challenge entries): the primary video must be generated with Wan3 on TopView, in our TopView
   project.** Other tools may make reference images (our ChatGPT plates are allowed if we hold the rights;
   keep each chat link as the licence record) and edit the cut, but a still or a clip from another model
   does not count as Wan3 footage.
   **Why hard:** scope; an entry that breaks it is disqualified, and "the organizer may verify the creation
   process, Topview project, and material licenses".

3. **Fair Use (TopView's pricing modal, read 2026-09-26):** "This feature is designed for personal, human use
   only - automation tools, credential sharing, or reselling access are strictly prohibited" and "Unlimited models
   and Free Generations on plans are accessible only via topview.ai and are not accessible on MCP/CLI, API or other
   automation methods"; unusual activity can pause Unlimited access for review. The text sits in the Unlimited
   terms and says nothing about paid credits. Before driving the site with `tools/topview_wan3.py`, the CEO chooses
   how the Generate click is made (runner, or the runner fills the form and a person clicks).
4. **The Free plan cannot generate** (*measured*): on Free (5 credits) "Generate 0.6" opened the pricing modal
   "UPGRADE YOUR PLAN", generated nothing and charged nothing. The runner stops before the click on "Free".

## 2 · References: positional, not named

- There is **no saved Element library** for Wan3. Each generation takes its own uploads: up to 10 images,
  5 videos, 5 audio (20 files), per TopView's page; the live caps are unverified.
- A reference is cited by its **upload order** (*measured*): uploads are labelled Image1, Image2... in the order
  they are added; pasted **`@Image1`** or **`<<<Image1>>>`** becomes a reference chip; **`@Image 1` with a space
  stays plain text and attaches nothing**; typing `@` opens an Image picker; each upload also inserts its own chip.
  `wan3_prompt.py` writes `@Image1`.
  [SUPERSEDED 2026-09-26] "`@Image 1` (inserted by the UI when you type `@`)... which token the live box accepts is
  unverified": the paste test and the chip read-back settled it.
- Name the subject in prose right after the tag and give the reference its job, as TopView's FAQ asks:
  "Name each uploaded reference and explain its job, then list the details that must remain consistent."
- **Every character, mount and prop that is in the shot needs its picture attached; a description in words does
  not draw it** (*measured* twice, 2026-09-26): the long take without THE MOUNT's picture came back with a wooden
  boat (G6 take 1, cdba365c), and G5, which described the mount in a full sentence (B.MOUNT_DARK), came back with the
  riders on a dark rock in all three shots (eddf53b3). Both were free generations, lost. `wan3_prompt.py` now adds
  the picture to every on-mount shot and refuses one without it (32179e07). If the picture carries something the
  shot must not show (the mount's lit lamps), attach it anyway and give it a job that says so, plus a picture of the
  wanted state beside it (@LanternDark) — words alone lost to a picture's detail on H3, and no picture lost worse
  on Wan3.

## 3 · The Direction box

- **20,000 characters** on the board generator (*measured*: the counter reads "0 / 20000" at
  `/board/...?tool-type=video-edit&model-id=qwen-wan3.0-video`). Our full H3-derived prompts (1,200-5,700) fit.
  [SUPERSEDED 2026-09-26] "3,500 characters maximum (Direction 513/3500)": read from a different page, not the
  generator we use.
- Several shots in one generation are allowed ("shot-level direction"), written as prose, as `[0-4s] ...`
  brackets, or as `Timeline: 0.0-3.0s | ...`.
- *Measured*: 2-30 s in 1 s steps; 480p ("SD 480p"), 720p, 1080p; aspects 9:16, 3:4, 1:1, 4:3, 16:9; a fresh board
  defaults to 9:16 / 30 s / 720p (set 16:9 every time); Generation Count 1-4; Auto Upscale and Internet Search off
  by default. The model picker also lists a separate "Wan 3.0 Prime" (30 s, fast); the plugin benefit excludes Prime.
- Whether Wan3 makes its own sound is unconfirmed.

## 4 · Prices and plans (topview.ai/pricing, 2026-09-25)

| | per second | notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1080p | 1 credit | *measured*: 2 s = 2 |
| 720p | 0.5 credit | *measured*: 2 s = 1, 30 s = 15; 0.4 with the 20 % off on Business, Ultra or Team annual |
| 480p | 0.3 credit | selectable (*measured*: 2 s = "Generate 0.6") |
| + Auto Upscale 4K | +0.4 credit | *measured* 2026-09-26, the button shows the sum: 720p+4K = 0.9/s (7 s 6.3, 9 s 8.1, 10 s 9, 15 s 13.5, 20 s 18, 30 s 27). Charged on free plugin generations too (12 on a 30 s clip). The generation part leaves the balance at submit, the upscale part when the upscale starts, while the task still reads `running` |

A paid fix costs by the second, so refire only the broken shot at the length the cut needs, one generation per
shot, rather than a 30 s group (CEO 2026-09-26: "ทำเฉพาะจุด ไม่แก้ 30s").

Pro $29/month = 80 credits (annual $16/month, 960 credits upfront) · Business $75 ($44 annual, 3,000/yr) ·
Ultra $150 ($50 annual, 500/month) and Team list **"Wan 3.0 720P 365 Days Unlimited"** · top-up packs
250 / 600 / 1000 credits, valid 24 months.

## 5 · From an H3 previz prompt to a Wan3 prompt (the ILAG pipeline)

The shot is crafted on H3 (`CTO_MiniMax_H3`); the Wan3 prompt is derived from the H3 file that passed. The
two engines are different, so check each step on the first generation and write down what held.

1. **List the uploads in order** from the H3 file's `@handles` (first mention first), and upload the same
   single-panel pictures (Drive `Element/`, `ref-*.png` and the location plates). 10 images at most.
2. **Replace each `@Handle` with its position** (`@Image 1`...), keeping the fixed name after it:
   `@Image 2 THE YOUNG ONE, ...`.
3. **Length:** the generator takes 20,000 characters, so the full prompt goes in (the house-negatives wall is
   still dropped). `wan3_prompt.py` keeps its trim levels for a shorter box; they do not trigger at 20,000.
4. **Remove the H3 studio markers** (`overall_soundscape:` and `non_diegetic_music: none.`) and state the
   sound in plain words ("Sound: only the characters' own voices and breathing; no music, no ambience").
5. **Set** 720p (the challenge floor), 16:9, and the shot's seconds; one generation per H3 shot, unless
   several shots are deliberately joined with shot-level direction.
6. **Before the first paid run, one short test** (a few seconds) to learn which reference token works
   and whether dialogue is spoken, then write it in Field notes.

## Field notes
- 2026-09-26 [MISSING] §2 — the generator lives at `https://www.topview.ai/board/my-first-board?tool-type=video-edit&model-id=qwen-wan3.0-video` (redirects to the account's board); "Continue with Google" as pass.gob1 in the winbox automation Chrome (CDP 9224) completed with no prompt; selectors and the cost read are in `tools/topview_wan3.py` · evidence: agent run 2026-09-26, commits 1bab51c4 20629212 · status: pending
- 2026-09-26 [WRONG] §4 prices — a free plugin generation (button "27 0") covers the generation only; **Auto Upscale 4K is charged on top, every clip**: 12 for a 30-s clip, 8 for a 20-s clip (G7: 187 → 179). The CTO told the CEO "4K free" from a stale read; it was not · evidence: fresh balances 245 → 197 over 4 free-clip upscales; board 4252ab77 · status: promoted (§4 upscale row; measured on 8 more clips)
- 2026-09-26 [MISSING] §4 prices — the upscale is deducted **when the upscale starts, while the task still reads `running`**, not when the clip arrives: 149 → 137 → 113 with G1/G2/G6r2 (a64739b7, 2546374a, 8e0a40b0) all `running`. Budget it at submit · evidence: fresh_balance.py reads 03:12–03:28 UTC · status: promoted (§4 upscale row; 113 -> 92.5 at four submits, same pattern)
- 2026-09-26 [MISSING] §4 prices — read the balance only from a **freshly loaded** board tab (`button[aria-label="Credits"]`, wait for a digit); a tab left open kept showing 245 while the real balance was 197. At each submit the balance also dips by the generation price for ~1 min on a free clip, then returns (a hold) · evidence: stale read_balance.py vs fresh_balance.py, same minute · status: pending
- 2026-09-26 [MISSING] §5 pipeline (collecting) — parallel runs on one board mix up when collected as "the newest video on the board". Collect by task id: tRPC `board.task.create` returns taskId, `board.task.getBatchDetail` gives status, creditsCost and the cloudfront mp4 URLs (winbox `C:\mooniex\ilag-runner\tools\collect_tasks.py`). A 30-s 4K clip took 25–60+ min, so a runner's own wait times out; submit with `--timeout-s 45` and collect separately · evidence: g1–g7 run 2026-09-26 · status: pending
- 2026-09-26 [MISSING] §2 references — an on-mount shot with neither the mount's picture nor the words for it came back with **a wooden boat** under the riders (G6 take 1, cdba365c). Every on-mount shot carries `@Manta` or a mount state line; `wan3_prompt.py` now refuses to build one without it · evidence: 52eead0d, G6 retake 8e0a40b0 · status: promoted (§2 rule; second sighting G5 eddf53b3 on 2026-09-26)
- 2026-09-26 [MISSING] §3 multi-shot — Alibaba's Wan 3.0 guide (alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/wan3-video-generation-guide, updated 24 Sep): "multi-shot storyboard format (4~6 seconds per shot, with timestamp annotations)", duration 2~30 s; the prompt guide's syntax is `Shot 1 [0-3 s] ..., Shot 2 [3-6 s] ...` with "Hard cut transition". No vendor (Alibaba, ByteDance Seedance 2.0/2.5) documents sub-second cuts; ByteDance advises chases/montages be made as separate clips and cut in the edit. Our most cuts measured in one Wan3 clip: 4 (G4). A 0.5-0.8 s fast-cut montage is therefore an edit job: fire coverage (≈3 s shots, one angle + one obstacle each) and cut in CapCut · evidence: g9/g9c prompts 88ad6205 0160aa89, research 2026-09-26 · status: pending
- 2026-09-27 [MISSING] §5 pipeline — the Wan3 renderer drops the house-negatives wall, which carried "no humans". G9p asked for "two villagers carry a beam" with no picture tied to them and drew two HUMAN men (human faces, hair, headbands) at 6 s, and two more behind the nets at 3-4 s; the villagers tied to a picture (the plump woman from @Villagers2) came out right. Every Wan3 prompt keeps an explicit `NO_HUMANS` line in its own negatives · evidence: g9p task 762178ee (4K, md5 ddae002c), frame 6.0 s · status: pending
- 2026-09-27 [MISSING] §4 prices — a 30-s 16-cut clip (G9p) first died server-side: "Read timed out (read timeout=3600) credits have been refunded" (task 1e27067f); balance went 76.1 → 61.1 → back to 76.1, the 4K part never charged. The identical refire finished in 20 min. The second taskId in the runner's ledger ("status":"init") is not a board task; the real one is in board.task.create's body · status: pending
